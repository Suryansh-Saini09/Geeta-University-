  {
    question: "How do I apply for a scholarship at Geeta University?",
    answer:
      "You can apply for scholarships during your online application submission. You will need to upload your qualifying marksheet, entrance test scorecard (GUTS, CUET, JEE, NEET, etc.), or relevant category certificates (defense, sports, domicile). The scholarship committee evaluates documents and applies the fee waiver immediately in your provisional admission letter.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the scholarship applicable for all semesters of my program?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the scholarship awarded at the time of admission continues for subsequent academic years, provided the student maintains the minimum prescribed CGPA (typically >= 7.5) with no backlogs and follows the university's code of academic discipline.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine two different scholarships?",
    answer:
      "Students are eligible to avail the single highest scholarship category for which they qualify (e.g., between Qualifying Merit, GUTS, CUET, or Sports). Multiple percentage waivers cannot be clubbed together on tuition fee.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Geeta University offer Education Loan assistance?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Geeta University has formal tie-ups with leading nationalized and private banks (including SBI, PNB, HDFC, ICICI, and Axis Bank) as well as NBFCs to facilitate fast-track educational loan approvals with subsidized student interest rates.",
  },
  {
    question: "What amenities are included in the hostel fee?",
    answer:
      "Hostel charges include fully furnished AC/Non-AC accommodation, 4-time nutritious meals (breakfast, lunch, evening snacks, and dinner), 24x7 high-speed Wi-Fi, laundry facilities, 24/7 security with CCTV surveillance, medical emergency assistance, and gymnasium access.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the fee refund policy in case of withdrawal?",
    answer:
      "Geeta University strictly adheres to the UGC fee refund guidelines. Full refund (with minimal nominal processing deduction) is provided within the UGC-stipulated admission closure window.",
  },
