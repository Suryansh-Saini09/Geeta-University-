              Identifying well with individuals leads to better relationships and, at times,
              friendships. By developing your social skills you become more{" "}
              <strong className="text-[#0A1F44] font-bold">charismatic</strong>, which is a desirable
              trait. People are more interested in charismatic people as non-charismatic people are
              (or at least appear to be) more influenced by them. Most people know you cannot advance
              far in life without strong interpersonal relationships.

              Focusing on relationships will help you get a job, get promoted and make new friends.
              Well honed social skills can increase your happiness and satisfaction and give you a
              better outlook on life. Better relationships can also help to reduce the negative
              effects of <strong className="text-[#0A1F44] font-bold">stress</strong> and boost
              your <strong className="text-[#0A1F44] font-bold">self-esteem</strong>.

              If you are good with people, you can more easily avoid being with the people you do
              not like as much as others. Some people dread social interactions because they do not
              wish to spend time with individuals who do not have similar interests and viewpoints.
              It is a lot easier to attend a meeting at work or a party in your personal life if you
              know at least some of the people who will be there.

              If you are in a social situation and do not want to spend time with &apos;John&apos; because you
              don&apos;t like him or he cannot help you with a particular issue, a good set of social
              skills will allow you to politely convey that you need to spend time with other people
              at the get together.
